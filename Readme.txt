What is Caesar Cipher?
         
           The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique that was used by Julius Caesar to send secret messages to his allies. It works by shifting the letters in the plaintext message by a certain number of positions, known as the “shift” or “key”. The Caesar Cipher technique is one of the earliest and simplest methods of encryption techniques.



Example:
Text : ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
Shift: 23
Cipher: XYZABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVW

Text : ATTACKATONCE
Shift: 4
Cipher: EXXEGOEXSRGI






Advantages:

    Easy to implement and use thus, making suitable for beginners to learn about encryption.
    Can be physically implemented, such as with a set of rotating disks or a set of cards, known as a scytale, which can be useful in certain situations.
Requires only a small set of pre-shared information.
Can be modified easily to create a more secure variant, such as by using a multiple shift values or keywords.

Disadvantages:

     It is not secure against modern decryption methods.
     Vulnerable to known-plaintext attacks, where an attacker has access to both the encrypted and unencrypted versions of the same messages.
     The small number of possible keys means that an attacker can easily try all possible keys until the correct one is found, making it vulnerable to a brute force attack.
     It is not suitable for long text encryption as it would be easy to crack.
     It is not suitable for secure communication as it is easily broken.
     Does not provide confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity in a message.
